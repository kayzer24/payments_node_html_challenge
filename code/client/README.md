# HTML Client

This is the HTML client for Townsend Street Music Shop's website.  There are additional CSS, JavaScript and image files in the `assets` directory, but we don't expect you to need to modify any of them.

## Project Structure

As you work through the project milestones, here are the key places you'll need to make client-side changes:

- `/lessons.html` → the lesson sign up page shown in the screen shots above.
